    //Understanding Encapsulation with Setter methods
    /*
    Encapsulation in Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that bundles data (fields/variables) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit â€” the class.
    It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, usually through access modifiers like private, public, and protected.

    Key Points of Encapsulation:

    Data Hiding:
    Fields are marked as private to hide them from outside classes.
    Access is controlled via getter and setter methods.

    Controlled Access:
    Getters (getFieldName()) provide read access.
    Setters (setFieldName(value)) provide write access with optional validation.

    Increased Flexibility & Security:
    Internal data can be changed without affecting external code.
    It ensures that only valid data is assigned to variables.

    //Benefits of Encapsulation:
    //Protects data from unintended modifications.
    //Enhances code maintainability and flexibility.
    //Promotes modularity and reusability.
